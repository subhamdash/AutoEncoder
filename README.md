# AutoEncoder
Autoencoders (AE) are a family of neural networks for which the input is the same as the output. They work by compressing the input into a latent-space representation and then reconstructing the output from this representation.

It is an unsupervised learning technique,If the input features were each independent of one another, this compression and subsequent reconstruction would be a very difficult task. However, if some sort of structure exists in the data (ie. correlations between input features), this structure can be learned and consequently leveraged when forcing the input through the network's bottleneck.
